# Unity Background Build
Fire off a background build of your Unity project and continue working on the same project. Most useful for platforms that take a long time to build such as WebGL.

# How it works
After applying your settings and pressing build, this plugin duplicates your entire current project (first time), and then runs a batch mode build using the current settings.  Optionaly it launches the build when complete.  On subsequent builds, it only replaces changed files.
